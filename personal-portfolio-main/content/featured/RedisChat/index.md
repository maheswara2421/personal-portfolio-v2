Developed a real-time chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO, and Redis for session management. Features multi-room support with instant message delivery, user presence indicators, and typing notifications. Implemented Redis pub/sub for scalable message broadcasting across multiple server instances. The application supports persistent chat history and reconnection handling.
