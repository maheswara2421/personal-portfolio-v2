### Explanation of the Console Warning

The warning you're seeing is: **"findDOMNode is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Instead, add a ref directly to the element you want to reference."**

#### What It Means:
- `findDOMNode`  was a React method to access the DOM node of a component, but it's been deprecated since React 16 and is fully removed in React 18+ (your project uses React 18.3.1).
- The warning comes from `react-transition-group`  (version 4.4.5 in your project), specifically the `CSSTransition`  component used in your [Nav](cci:1://file:///C:/Users/karti/Downloads/personal-portfolio-main/src/components/nav.js:152:0-282:2) component for fade-in animations.
- `react-transition-group`  internally uses `findDOMNode`  to apply CSS transitions, which triggers this deprecation warning in strict mode (enabled in Gatsby dev).

#### Why It's Happening:
- Your [Nav](cci:1://file:///C:/Users/karti/Downloads/personal-portfolio-main/src/components/nav.js:152:0-282:2) component uses `CSSTransition`  for animating nav links and the logo on load/scroll.
- This is a library-level issueâ€”`react-transition-group`  hasn't fully updated to avoid `findDOMNode`  yet, but it's safe for now (the animations still work).
- The stack trace points to `TransitionGroup`  and `CSSTransition`  in your nav, confirming it's from the nav animations.

#### Impact:
- **Not critical**: It's a warning, not an error. Your site functions normally.
- **Future-proofing**: In React 19, this will break. Consider upgrading to `react-transition-group`  v5+ (if available) or switching to libraries like `framer-motion`  for smoother animations.
- The 500 error on `/#contact`  might be unrelated or a side effectâ€”check if the contact section loads; it could be a build issue.

#### Quick Notes:
- No immediate action needed unless you want to silence it.
- If you decide to fix it later, we could replace `react-transition-group`  with a ref-based solution or a different animation library.
- The rest of your portfolio (logo, photo, resume link) is working as expected.

If the site isn't loading properly or you have more errors, share them! Otherwise, it's ready for GitHub push and Netlify deploy. ðŸŽ‰
